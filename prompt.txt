Please suggest a small microservice project that uses Java 21, the latest Spring Boot, MySQL, and Podman.
The project should include:

Distributed observability: traceId, spanId, correlationId, structured logging, and MDC

Monitoring

Distributed transactions (Saga pattern)

Multithreaded execution with proper propagation of tracing context

Additionally, please provide:

A step-by-step learning plan

A full architecture diagram for the project

My goal is to learn distributed observability and monitoring (traceId, spanId, logs, correlationId) in a multithreaded environment, along with distributed transactions.

Hi Bianca/Fidel,
There is some issue with my brotherâ€™s business. He is having some difficulties here in Irving and he is requesting me to help him in the morning till 10:00 am.

If you allow me, I would like to help him and login to USAA at 10:30am and work until 6:30pm, I will make sure to complete all my work on time as usual.

If you allow me I will skip morning standup, and provide my updates on slack channel before standup and attend all other meetings after 10:30 am. 

I would appreciate your kind consideration.
